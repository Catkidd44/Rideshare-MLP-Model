# Rideshare-MLP-Model
Trained a model using logistics regression and Multi-layer neural netowrk and achieved a good MSE when predicting Rideshares in the New York City Area.

I got my hands on two datasets for ridehsares in New York and ecided to run a machine leanring project on them. The basic idea is to use two ML methods to generate reaosnable predictions and fine-tune the hyperparameters as much as I can to get better outcomes. 
I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
